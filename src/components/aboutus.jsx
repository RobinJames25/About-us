        <p>
          #ikokazicoast is one of Coast Jobs' most impactful campaigns, created to
          challenge the narrative that there are no jobs in the Coastal region. The 
          truth is --<span>there are plenty of opportunities</span> in companies, hotels and 
          institutions across the Coast. The problem? Many of them go unadvertised
          or unheard. That's where we come in--to <span>uncover and amplify</span> these jobs
          so that many youths can access them. Coast jobs is on a mission to prove
          that opportunities do exist right here in the Coastal region--from Mombasa 
          to Lamu, Taita to Tana River. The jobs might not always be easy to find, but 
          we're here to uncover them, post them, and connect you to them.
